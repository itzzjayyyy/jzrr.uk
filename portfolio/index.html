            <div class="project-title">Tower Defense Game</div>
            <div class="project-description">
              I have created many games in Roblox Studio, and one of the most ambitious is a tower defense game. Although the project is still in development, it has already given me valuable experience in designing complex systems and ensuring smooth gameplay. A key part of this type of game is the placement system, which lets players place towers strategically on the map. Implementing this required careful thought about grid alignment, collision detection, and user interface feedback to make placements feel intuitive and responsive. To make the game secure and reliable, I focused heavily on client-server communication. In Roblox, this means using RemoteEvents to send placement requests from the client to the server, where all critical checks happen. By validating tower positions and player resources on the server side, I could prevent exploits like free placements or bypassing cooldowns. This approach keeps the game fair and competitive, even in multiplayer settings. Beyond placement mechanics, I’ve also worked on wave spawning systems, enemy pathfinding, and damage calculation logic. Each of these systems is essential to a tower defense game. They required modular scripting and event-driven design so they could be easily extended as the game grows. For instance, adding new tower types or enemy behaviors can happen without rewriting the entire codebase. This is thanks to how I structured the scripts. This project has improved my skills in secure scripting, modular design, and gameplay balancing. It has also taught me how to anticipate edge cases and build systems that scale. It shows my ability to combine creativity with technical skill, producing games that are not only fun to play but also strong in their performance.

            <div class="project-title">General Programming Language Experience</div>
            <div class="project-description">
              I have experience with several programming languages, which have helped me explore different aspects of development and problem-solving. For example, HTML is shown directly through this website. I’ve built and styled pages to showcase my projects. Working with HTML and CSS has given me a strong foundation in web design, responsive layouts, and creating user-friendly interfaces that look good on all devices. Beyond web development, I also work with Python, a flexible language I’ve used for scripting, automation, and experimenting with data-driven projects. Python’s readability and extensive libraries make it ideal for building quick prototypes, handling APIs, and performing tasks like parsing data or automating workflows. My experience with Python has taught me how to organize code efficiently and use external modules to add functionality. I also have significant experience with Lua, especially through my work in Roblox Studio. Lua’s lightweight nature makes it great for game scripting. I’ve used it to create mechanics like placement systems, GUI interactions, and server-client communication. Working with Lua has sharpened my understanding of event-driven programming and helped me develop secure, scalable scripts that improve gameplay while protecting against exploits. All these languages have given me a broad skill set in frontend design, backend logic, and game development. I can adjust to different environments and pick the right tool for each project. They also show my ability to learn quickly, experiment, and apply my programming knowledge in both practical and fun ways.

            <div class="project-title">Computer Knowledge</div>
            <div class="project-description">
              I have a lot of experience with computer hardware and software. This includes building custom PCs and setting up operating systems for the best performance. Over time, I’ve gained a solid understanding of component compatibility, system assembly, and troubleshooting techniques. This knowledge helps me design and maintain machines for specific needs, whether for gaming, development, or server hosting. In addition to hardware, I’ve worked with several operating systems, like Windows, Linux distributions, and Raspberry Pi OS. This experience has given me practical knowledge of installation processes, partitioning, driver management, and system optimization. I enjoy trying out different environments to see how software interacts with hardware at a low level. I’ve also programmed Raspberry Pis to handle practical tasks. One significant project involved setting up a Pi as a lightweight web server using Nginx and Docker. This work required me to manage containerized applications, set up reverse proxies, and ensure reliable uptime on limited hardware. This project taught me important lessons about scalability, networking, and resource management. It also showed me how small, affordable devices can be used for real-world applications. These experiences have helped me tackle technical challenges with a mix of realism and creativity. Whether I’m assembling a physical machine, deploying services on embedded hardware, or trying out new tools to expand functionality, I feel prepared to face the task.

        <div class="project-title">Discord Bot</div>
        <div class="project-description">
                     
          I have developed several Discord bots, each with its own unique features and challenges. One of my most notable projects was an invite tracker bot. This bot was meant to monitor server growth and accurately link new members to the right inviter. Building it required a solid understanding of JavaScript and the Discord.js library. I also needed to manage complex math and positioning logic to ensure every invite was tracked correctly, even in tricky situations like deleted or expired links. To make it work well, I included strong error handling and server-side validation checks. This made the bot reliable during heavy use and protected it from exploits. The system was modular, which let me easily add new features like leaderboards, persistent storage, and dynamic reporting. This project also gave me experience in data visualization. I created a custom welcome card generator using Node-Canvas. The card displays the user’s avatar, server information, and stylized text, providing a polished and engaging experience for new members. You can see the image of the generated welcome card below. It shows my ability to blend backend logic with creative user interface design. Beyond this bot, I've built moderation tools, notification systems, and fun, context-aware response features. Each project has helped me improve my skills in event-driven programming, API integration, and modular design. I also learned how important it is to create bots that are both technically sound and enjoyable for communities.
